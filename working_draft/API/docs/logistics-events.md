Logistics events are events related to the management and execution of transport and logistics services and document the occurrence of actions, discrepancies, or status changes. These events can be either internal or external to an organization and can include transportation, warehousing, inventory management, supply chain optimization, and other related activities. Examples of logistics events include the departure of an aircraft or the acceptance of shipments in a warehouse.

**Guidelines for Logistics Events in ONE Record:**

- Logistics Events are immutable. They MUST NOT be changed after creation.
- List of logistics Events attached to Logistics Objects are event stores. This event store is an append-only log. Events CAN be added by using the HTTP POST method (see [Create a Logistics Event](#create-a-logistics-event)) but MUST NOT be changed or deleted.
- Logistics Events are neither logistics objects nor embedded object
- Every Logistics Events MUST an URI, that follows the following structure:
<LogisticsObject>/events/<logisticsEventId> where <logisticsEventId> is
- A Logistics Event MUST BE linked to exactly one Logistics Object
- Every Logistics Event MUST have a property `occuredAt (xsd:dateTime)`

# Logistics Events URI

Every Logistics Event MUST have globally unique identifier, a 


# Create a Logistics Event

Logistics Events (also known as status updates) in ONE Record can be added to any Logistics Objects 
by sending a HTTP POST request containing a [LogisticsEvent](https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/cargo/3.0.0#LogisticsEvent) object to the `/logistics-events` endpoint of a LogisticsObject.

As for all API interactions, the ONE Record client must be authenticated and have the access rights to perform this action.

As Logistics Events MUST be associated with a specific Logistics Object, creating Logistics Events requires the existence of a Logistics Object. 

## Request

The following HTTP header parameters MUST be present in the request:

| Request Header   | Description                         | Examples            |
| ---------------- |  --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Accept**       | The content type that the ONE Record client wants the HTTP response to be formatted in.        | application/ld+json |
| **Content-Type** | The content type that is contained with the HTTP body. Valid content types. | application/ld+json |

The HTTP request body must contain a valid [LogisticsEvent](https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/cargo/3.0.0#LogisticsEvent) in the format as specified by the Content-Type in the header.

The LogisticsEvent is a data class of the [ONE Record cargo ontology](https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/cargo/3.0.0).
The properties and relationships to other data classes are visualized in the following class diagram.

# Get Logistic Events of a Logistics Object

Logistics events that are linked to a logistics object CAN be retrieved by doing a HTTP GET request to the the `/logistics-events` endpoint of a logistics object.
In addition, only a subset of all linked logistics events can optionally be retrieved by setting filter parameters.

As for all API interactions, the ONE Record client must be authenticated and have the access rights to perform this action.

## Request

The following HTTP header parameters MUST be present in the request:
